# The names are we give to variables are called Identifires
#we need to follow certain rules whilw define identifires.
#e.g UserID= 101
#here UserID is the identifire
#Rule 1 - Python is case sensetive. means UserID and Userid are two different variables.

#Rule 2 - we can use any numbers in between variable name e.g user123ID, userID1234. but variable name should not shart with any number e.g 123userID

#Rule 3 - we are also use underscore e.g User_ID you can use any number of underscore at the end of variable name e.g User_id____
#But underscore at the beginning  of the variable name e.g _user_id have different meaning in python
# single Underscore at the beginning e.g _userid  means the method or variable is private
# Double Underscore at the beginning e.g __userid  means the method or variable is really private
# Double Underscore at the beginning and ending e.g __user_id__ means that function is the special function or magic function.

# we can not use any spacial character in the variable name e.g !@#$%^&*()
# we can not use key word as a variable name. e.g if

userID=123
print(userID)

userid=98
print(userid)
